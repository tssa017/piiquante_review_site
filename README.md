# Piiquante

I built a secure API for this hot sauce rating website with MongoDB, Express, and Mongoose. This was project 6 for the OpenClassrooms Web Developer path.

## To view the project

FIrst, clone the frontend for the site

```bash
git clone git@github.com:OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/Web-Developer-P6.git
```

Then clone the backend I wrote:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tssa017/piiquante_review_site.git
```

Add a directory named 'images' to the root of the backend

Launch the backend server with the following commands:

```bash
cd backend
nodemon server
```

Launch the frontend with the following commands:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```
